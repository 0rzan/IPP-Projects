# IPP (Individual programing project) at University of Warsaw, 2021/22

## Labyrinth
The objective was to create a program that finds the shortest route in a complex maze with multiple dimensions. The main challenge involved verifying the accuracy of the program's input and effectively storing it in the computer's memory, particularly when dealing with large labyrinth dimensions.

## Phone forward
The goal was to develop a program that manages the process of forwarding telephone numbers. A telephone number was defined as any sequence of characters consisting of digits 0 to 9, as well as the symbols "*" and "#". The instructions for the program's interface can be found in the file phone_forward.h, which was mostly provided by the task's author. The entire module is documented using the doxygen format.
